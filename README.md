Before creating a Google number, you must already have a Google account and a number with a traditional phone service (either a landline or a mobile carrier). To sign up for Google Voice to get your free phone number:

1. Go to the Google Voice page. Select For personal use and choose Android, iOS, or Web. No matter which option you select, you can use the number from any of your devices after setting it up.
2. Sign in to your Google account if prompted and accept the terms of service.
3. Start typing an area code or city in the search bar, then choose Select next to the number you want from the list.
4. Select Verify, enter the phone number you want to link, then select Send code.
5. Google will send you a text message with a code. Enter the code, then select Verify again.
6. Select Finish. You can now make calls and send texts with your Google Voice number.
